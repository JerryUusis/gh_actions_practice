# Github actions practice

## Install Nektos `act` to run workflows locally

Navigate to [https://nektosact.com/usage/index.html](https://nektosact.com/usage/index.html) and follow instructions how to run install Nektos Act on your device. It will allow you to run github actions locally, so you can test them without doing a push to your repository every time you want to test you actions. NOTE: You need to have Docker installed on your device. `act` will create an image where an environment is simulated.

Once installed, type `act` in the terminal to emulate a push action to your repository.
